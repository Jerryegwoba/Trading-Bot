## ✅ Phase 2: Strategy Development (Week 3–6)

### 🎯 Primary Strategies:
#### **Breakout Strategy:**
- Entry on breakout of key levels with volume confirmation.
- Uses Bollinger Bands, Volume Oscillator.
- TP/SL dynamically set based on ATR.

#### **Trendline Strategy:**
- Entry on trendline bounce with RSI and candle confirmation.
- TP/SL based on last swing high/low.

#### **MA Cross + RSI Filter Strategy:**
- EMA(9) crosses EMA(21), with RSI confirming direction.
- Good for trend continuation trades.

## ✅ Phase 3: Asset Specialization (Week 6–8)

### ⚙️ Optimized Asset Strategies

#### 🥇 Gold (XAU/USD):
- **Scalping:** Use 1M/5M charts, look for volatility breakouts using Keltner Channels + VWAP.
- **Swing:** 1H/4H trend continuation using EMA cross and Fibonacci levels.

#### 💱 Forex (Major Pairs):
- **Scalping:** Trade London & NY overlaps. Use OBV + Stochastic + RSI.
- **Swing:** Weekly trends based on RSI divergence + MACD + COT data.

#### 🛢️ Commodities (Oil, Silver):
- **Scalping:** High-volatility breakouts using Bollinger Squeeze + ADX.
- **Swing:** Trend-following using MA Cloud + Supply/Demand zones.

## 🧠 Phase 4: Risk & False Breakout Management (Week 8–10)

### 🔍 Spotting False Breakouts:
- Breaks key level but fails to close beyond it (look at body of candle).
- Volume does **not** confirm move (low volume = high trap chance).
- RSI divergence at breakout level.
- Breakout candle is a doji/pinbar (indecision).

### 🛡️ Guard Mechanisms:
- Require **2 candle closes** beyond breakout level.
- Confirm with **volume spike** and **momentum indicators**.
- Use ATR filter to avoid low-volatility traps.
- Run a delayed-entry variant: Enter on pullback after breakout.
